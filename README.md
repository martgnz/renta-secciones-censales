This is a parser for a new [income dataset by census tract](https://www.ine.es/experimental/atlas/exp_atlas_tab.htm) released by the Spanish Statistics Institute.

## Getting started
First, install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Then, you can run the scraper

```bash
npm run build
```

After that you'll have a folder full of CSV files. The `r/` folder contains the code to clean and merge all the files
